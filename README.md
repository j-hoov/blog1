### Art Piece 1

Roy Ascott’s “Change Paintings” is the first piece of his retrospective exhibition “The Syncretic Sense.” The piece was originally shown in 1961, which we might consider old for a “new media” art piece. Made of a series of Plexiglass slabs, viewers participate in the piece by rearranging the slabs to make new images. This piece may not contain virtual reality or robotics, but it is inherently interactive. The art exists in the interaction of the viewer with the piece – a finite set of unchanging composite parts, visually transformed by the actions of the person present. “The Syncretic Sense” showcased “Change Paintings” along with several of Ascott’s later works from the 20th century; these works were displayed at Plymouth Arts Centre from April 4 – May 24, 2009. 

What drew me to the piece was its importance in the origins of new media art. Roy Ascott coined the term “telematic art” – “art projects using computer mediated telecommunications networks as their medium” – in a sense he foretold our digital age of interaction and exchange over computer networks. His early pieces reflect the most important attribute of this art genre: connectivity. Ascott portrays “the desire to be with people” through his art, told through a lens of biological and technological systems. In this piece I see the beginnings of new media art and the age of digital exchange, a sort of prophecy in Plexiglas and paint.
